# Weather App - Project Documentation

This portfolio project involved building a weather forecast application using React.js, and making API calls to Pexels and WeatherAPI. The application takes in a location input and returns a 14-day weather forecast for that location along with an associated image from Pexels.

## What I did

- React Components and State Management: Created a functional React component `Home` that handles state using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

- API Calls: Used axios to make GET requests to the Pexels and WeatherAPI APIs, providing search queries and handling responses.

- Conditional Rendering: Implemented conditional rendering in React to handle the display of data based on whether the forecast data was available or not.

- Styling and CSS: Used CSS for custom component styling, implemented background images for visual appeal.

- Scroll Functionality: Implemented custom horizontal scrolling functionality using the `wheel` event and `useRef` hook.

## What I learned

- React Hooks: This project deepened my understanding of React hooks, specifically `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. I learned how to manage component state and side effects in a functional component, and how to reference DOM elements directly in React.

- API Integration: I gained practical experience in integrating third-party APIs in a React application. I understood the process of making API calls, handling responses, and error cases.

- Styling: This project enhanced my skills in CSS, especially with dynamic styling based on state and implementing custom scrolling behavior. I also learned some specific techniques, such as the use of gradiant overlay on top of the image to improve the usability.

- Error Handling: I learned the importance of handling error cases while making API calls and how to provide feedback to the user in such cases.
